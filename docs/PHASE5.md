# Phase 5 — Audio Reconstruction

**Status:** in progress.

Phase 5 begins from the Phase-4-complete portable simulation. Its job is to reconstruct the original audio behavior behind a portable event/mixer boundary without changing established gameplay semantics.

## Initial work

- inventory every gameplay/presentation sound event and its source asset;
- recover DirectSound voice-pool allocation/reuse, priority, stop/restart and overlap behavior;
- recover volume/pan/loop semantics and distinguish Windows DirectSound from DOS HMI behavior;
- connect native `GameSession` semantic sound requests to a portable audio event layer;
- preserve deterministic gameplay RNG ownership while documenting any audio/presentation RNG consumers;
- add asset-free event-order regression tests before platform playback backends.

## Non-goals

Exact whole-runtime trace parity remains Phase 6, end-to-end shareware discrepancy closure remains Phase 7, and registered-only content remains Phase 8.
